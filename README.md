# HasteTogether
*A work-in-progress multiplayer mod for the Haste: Broken Worlds demo*
(and hopefully the full-release)

This is both an attempt at multiplayer, and a learning experience for me to learn more C#, so code may be unoptimized, or completely generated for me to step through and work upon.<br>
It's not yet in a playable state, so don't expect much if you attempt to build it.
